    "Given 12 data points of the average temperatures on the 16th day for each month in a year at StonyBrook fit the data points in the cubic polynomial $P_3(t)=a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + a_3t^3$\n",

    "#### Algorithm Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm I will be using to create the fit for this cubic polynomial will be Least Square Error curve fitting. The formula and reasoning is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "Given an inconsistent system of form Ax = b, we can solve $A^TA\\bar{x} = A^Tb$ for the least squares solution. In this case since we are trying to do a cubic fit of the form $a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + a_3t^3$, our Ax = b will be the system of equations created by plugging in our points into the cubic function we were given. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we are passing in $1, t, t^2, t^3$ to create matrix A as this matrix multiplied by our coefficients represented by x should lead to the y values of our points, otherwise represented by b here. We can now solve our inconsistent system here for what the coefficients of this  function will be as we can isolate for $\\bar{x}$ giving us the values for $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$. With this we now know the fit function and can compute it at a specific point.  \n",
